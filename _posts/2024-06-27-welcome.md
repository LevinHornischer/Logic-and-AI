Welcome to the blog of the [Logic and AI](/about/) project! This first post explains what the blog will be about, before diving into actual content in the next posts.

The project is about re-mapping the landscape of logic and AI after the deep learning revolution. Despite tremendous successes, modern AI still struggles with explainability, interpretability, and verifiability. Historically, logic exceled at these desiderata. So the goal of the project is to identifying concrete and promising questions how _exactly_ logic can help AI. These question will then also pose exciting new problems and research directions for logic.

The plan for the blog is that each post will introduce one subfield of logic and AI, by specifying 
* what the questions are, 
* how they contribute to advance explainability, interpretability, verifiability, or theory, and
* which logical tools are used to answer these questions.
