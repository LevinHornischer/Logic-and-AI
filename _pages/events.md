# Kick-off workshop: 16-17 July 2024

This workshop brought together international experts on the topic of "Logic and AI" with the goal of exploring the promising interactions of these two fields. We had 8 talks subdivided into 3 topics: 
(a) different forms of neuro-symbolic integration, (b) expressive and computational power of machine learning, and (c) the intersection of causality, logic, and machine learning.
 
The talks are listed below (you can click on the title to see the slides, if available), and the workshop website is [here](https://ias.uva.nl/content/events/2024/07/logic-and-ai.html?origin=PRy12xnsQemXLkKbh0An2g&cb).

We very much enjoyed the many inspiring discussions bridging the different areas of the field. We warmly thank the speakers, the on-site participants, and especially also the many online participants for their contributions to the workshop!
